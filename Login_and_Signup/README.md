# <u>Login and Signup</u>

#### 						We have designed a simple yet minimalistic design for our Login and Signup page. This gives a better user interface and experience. There are two dart files, these can be accessed from lib-->>main.dart. Open the terminal and type in the following command in to run the app in an emulator or an android device.

```
flutter run
```

#### 					We have also created a unique icon pack for the app. When the user clicks on the app he is confronted with the Login page if he/she have already registered.
